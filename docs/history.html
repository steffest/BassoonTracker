<h3>Select/cut/copy/paste ranges of a pattern</h3>
<div class="padded">
    You can select a range in recording mode by just dragging over the pattern or by shift-dragging in any mode.<br>
    Ranges can include multiple colums.<br>
    An edit menu will appear when the range is selected.<br>
    You can also create ranges with your keyboard (Shift + arrow keys) and use the regular keyboard shortcuts for Select All, Copy, Cut, Paste.<br>
    Consult the <a href="#keyboard_commands">keyboard commands</a> for the complete list.

<h3>Sample Editor</h3>
<div class="padded">
    The sample editor has been expanded.<br>
    You can now select ranges, zoom, cut/copy/paste pieces of samples, adjust volume, apply fades, etc ...<br>
    The regular keyboard shortcuts for Select All, Copy, Cut, Paste can be used.<br>
    Each effect applies to the selected range or - if you don't have a selecion - to the entire sample.<br>
    The "upsample" and "downsample" commands will double or half the samplerate of the sample - which is rather desctructive so use wisely.<br>
    Downsample is mainly used if you want to push hi-res samples intended for the 8-octave range of Fasttracker into the 3-octave range of Protracker.
