<h3>Social sharing</h3>
<div class="padded">
Found a nice song you want to share with the world?<br>
Just click the share icon and you'll get a link that you can share on social media or in a chat.<br>
<img src="_img/share.png">
<br>
If you want to share a song that you've created yourself, you will have to put it online first (Try <a href="https://amp.dascene.net/" target="_blank">Amp</a> or
<a href="https://modarchive.org/" target="_blank">ModArchive</a>)<br>
You can then create a shareable link to your song by using the url in the "file" parameter. (<a href="https://www.stef.be/bassoontracker?file=https%3A%2F%2Famp.dascene.net%2Fdownmod.php%3Findex%3D167822">Like this</a>)
</div>
<h3>And more!</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Tooltips! little help balloons if you linger your mouse pointer over an element.</li>
    <li>Use the Media buttons (Play/pause/next/previous) to control playback</li>
    <li>The Code has been modernized and has been moved to ES Modules</li>
    <li>Support for Gzip compressed files (as used by <a href="https://amp.dascene.net/" target="_blank">Amp</a>)</li>
    <li>We now use a device-independent keyboard handler, so entering notes using your keyboard works the same on QWERTY, QWERTZ, AZERTY, DVORAK and other layouts</li>
    <li>More FX: Delay, Compression and Distortion (Thanks "No Zak_ no Kings")</li>
    <li>You can now load FLAC and OGG compressed samples (Thanks DrSnuggles)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 0.4</h2>

The focus of this release was polishing the experience for creating music with lots of usability improvements in the editing part.

Most notable new features:
<h3>Midi support</h3>
<div class="padded">
    You can enable/disable it in the Options.<br>
    It's still fairly basic as only midi-in is supported and there's no midi-mapping yet, but still a big step forward.<br>
    If you enable it, you can choose to only record the notes, or the key-velocity as well.<br>
    <img src="_img/midi.png"><br>
    Optionally, you can also choose to have little midi-in and key-in signal indicators on screen.<br>
    <img src="_img/midiin.png"><br>
    Please note that for your note-off commands to be registered as well you have to
    <ul>
        <li>Be in XM-mode</li>
        <li>Record and playback at the same time</li>
        <li>Have the midi-settings to "Enabled Note-Volume"</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<h3>Undo/redo support</h3>
<div class="padded">
    Available both in the pattern editor and in the sample editor.<br>
    The usual Ctrl-Z and Ctrl-Y shortcuts can be used.
    <img src="_img/undo.png">
</div>
<h3>Nibbles</h3>
<div class="padded">
    Ladies and Gentleman: It has arrived.<br>
    We finally tackled the last major hurdle for full FastTracker compatibility.<br><br>
    <b>WE HAVE <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bo2rr1X4dOg" target="_blank">NIBBLES</a> !!!</b>

    <img src="_img/nibbles.png">
    
    The full works as tribute to the legendary Triton, including 30 levels, highscores and some familiar hidden features.
</div>
<h3>Usability</h3>
<div class="padded">
    Lots of small and large usability improvements on the "edit" front:
    <ul>
        <li>Number boxes can now be edited with the keyboard and mousewheel/trackpad</li>
        <li>Menu can now be navigated with keyboard</li>
        <li>Sample editor zoom/navigation with mousewheel and keyboard</li>
        <li>Better range-selection in sample editor</li>
        <li>Insert/delete in patternlist</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="_img/editbox.png">
</div>
<h3>Crisp UI in High DPI screens.</h3>
<div class="padded">
    High-DPI screens (retina screens) sometimes loose the crispiness of the pixel graphics.<br>
    For those appreciating pixel-precission, there's a setting to fix that.<br>
    Basically it's the difference between the left end right part:
    <img src="_img/highDPI.png">
    Because it may have a performance impact it's not enabled by default but you can find it in the Options:
    <img src="_img/highDPI_setting.png">
</div>
<h3>And More</h3>
<div class="padded">
    <ul>
        <li>Lots of (subtle) XM playback compatibility fixes.</li>
        <li>Lots of small UI fixes.</li>
        <li>New "plugin" system. Additional features get side-loaded, keeping the core lean and mean (with Nibbles as a first example)</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<h2>Version 0.3.5</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Lots of bugfixes</li>
    <li>Browse button for Local Files</li>
    
</ul>

<h2>Version 0.3</h2>

Most notable new features:
<h3>FastTracker 2's XM support</h3>
<div class="padded">
    <img src="_img/xm.png">
    This includes support for:
    <ul>
        <li>up to 32 channels</li>
        <li>up to 128 instruments</li>
        <li>extra instrument properties like volume envelopes, panning envelopes, fadeout, more precise finetuning
        <li>extra effects like global volume</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="_img/xm_instrument.png">
</div>

<h3>Dropbox integration</h3>
<div class="padded">
    Load and save your files directly from and to Dropbox.<br>
    The first time you enable this feature, you will have to connect BassoonTracker to Dropbox and authorize it to access your files.<br>
    BassoonTracker will only have access to its own files in the "Apps/BassoonTracker" folder, not to your entire Dropbox.
    <img src="_img/dropbox.png">
</div>

<h3>Export entire song to .wav or .mp3</h3>
<div class="padded">
    Create a high-quality mixdown of your song to .wav or .mp3.<br>
    This feature requires an internet connection: Your file is uploaded to the BassoonTracker server and the conversion is done serverside.
    <img src="_img/exportmp3.png">
</div>

<h3>Select/cut/copy/paste ranges of a pattern</h3>
<div class="padded">
    You can select a range by just dragging over the pattern in recording mode, or by shift-dragging in any mode.<br>
    An edit menu will appear when the range is selected.<br>
    Ranges can include multiple colums.<br>
    You can also create ranges with your keyboard (Shift + arrow keys) and use the regular keyboard shortcuts for Select All, Copy, Cut, Paste.<br>
    Consult the <a href="#keyboard_commands">keyboard commands</a> for the complete list.
    <img src="_img/range.png">
</div>

<h3>Sample Editor</h3>
<div class="padded">
    The sample editor has been expanded.<br>
    You can now select ranges, zoom, cut/copy/paste pieces of samples, adjust volume, apply fades, etc.<br>
    The regular keyboard shortcuts for Select All, Copy, Cut, Paste can be used.<br>
    Each effect applies to the selected range or - if you don't have a selecion - to the entire sample.<br>
    The "upsample" and "downsample" commands will double or half the samplerate of the sample - which is rather desctructive so use wisely.<br>
    Downsample is mainly used if you want to push hi-res samples intended for the 8-octave range of FastTracker into the 3-octave range of Protracker.
