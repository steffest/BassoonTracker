<h2>Playlists</h2>

BassoonTracker supports playlists.
Some nice ones are included in the "Playlists" menu.

<br>
When playings songs from a playlist, the next song will automatically start when the current one ends.

<br>
You can control the playlist with the buttons at the bottom, as well as active shuffle play.

<br>
You can save and load playlists from the file menu.<br>
The default playlist format is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLS_(file_format)" target="_blank">.pls</a> that you can also use with other tracker-supporting software like
<a href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/" target="_blank">VLC</a> or <a href="https://support.xmplay.com/" target="_blank">XMPlay</a>.<br>
M3u and json formats are also supported.<br>
External playlists can be load from a URL using the "file" parameter. (<a href="https://www.stef.be/bassoontracker/dev.html?file=https://ftp.modland.com/pub/playlists/mags/Seenpoint/seenpoint_series.m3u">example</a>)

<br>
<br>
A particular nice way to explore is the "Random" playlist.

This will generate a list of 20 random songs from the <a href="https://modarchive.org/" target="_blank">Modarchive</a> database, that currently holds over
<b>50.000 MOD and XM songs</b>.<br></br>
<br>
If more curated lists are your cup of tea, you can check out the playlists that are collected by the nice folks at <a href="https://hippoplayer.se/" target="_blank">hippoplayer.se</a> that are nicely integrated in BassoonTracker.

    <br>
    Your favorites list is stored in your browser's local storage.<br>
    If you want to save it to a file, you can save it as a playlist.

<br>
If you have some nice playlists you want to share, please do!.<br/>
I'm also always open to new integration and cooperations.<br/>
