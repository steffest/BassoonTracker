    <p>When linking to BassoonTracker you can use the following URL parameters:</p>
    
    <table border="0">
        <tr>
            <td class="blue top">file=<i>URL</i></td>
            <td>You must provide an absolute URL to a module that is available online. You can point to online archives such as <a href="http://modland.com/pub/modules/Soundtracker/">Modland</a>.<br>
                BassoonTracker will open up with the module already loaded and ready to play/edit.<br>
                You should ideally provide an HTTPS link. If your chosen module is only available through HTTP, BassoonTracker will proxy it through its own server -- but this will inevitably be slower.<br>

                    Please note that the server where the module is stored should allow CORS request. If this is not the case, you can force to proxy it through the BassoonTracker server by prepending the url with "proxy/".<br>

            <td>This will (try to) autoplay the loaded file.<br>
                Please note that most browsers will block this, as they will only autoplay media files upon user interaction.<br>
                You can change this behaviour through your browser settings to allow audio for a specific domain.
